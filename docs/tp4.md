# Four Sparks (TP4): the production line

A measured TP4 serving line for four DGX Spark (GB10) nodes, built on this repository's launcher
(`start-tp4.sh` → `start.sh`), image layout, NVMe Engram row store, b12x MXFP8 route and memory
model. Everything it adds is armed only by `./start-tp4.sh`, which sets `DSV41_LAUNCHER=tp4`
before it execs `start.sh`. That flag is what turns on the named Dockerfile, `EXTRA_CONTAINER_ENV`,
the anchored worker rsync, EP 1 or 2 on the ring, and the production adapter hooks. The switches
still do nothing until the profile sets them. `./start.sh` leaves the flag unset, so the 3-Spark
profile (`.env`, `start.sh`) and the default `Dockerfile` keep their behaviour.

The per-change history, every earlier measurement and the experiments that were tried and not
adopted are in [knapcio/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-4x-DGX-Spark-TP4](https://github.com/knapcio/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-4x-DGX-Spark-TP4)
(`docs/history.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`). This page is the v2.1 state of that repository.

## Results

Production line (the last `EXTRA_CONTAINER_ENV` line of `.env.tp4.example` with `EP_SIZE=1`,
`Dockerfile.canary-roce` image), built from a fresh clone on all four nodes and measured on that
image with [sparkDash](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/sparkDash) 1.8.8: 256 new tokens, temperature 0,
thinking off, idle fleet, 2026-09-25, switched RoCE fabric. Engine start to healthy
160-170 s; KV pool 6.0-6.6M tokens (1M context). Raw output:
[`results/tp4/validation-20260925-v2.txt`](results/tp4/validation-20260925-v2.txt),
[`results/tp4/validation-20260925-v21.txt`](results/tp4/validation-20260925-v21.txt).

**Decode, aggregate tok/s (per stream in brackets)**

| prompt type | c1 | c2 | c4 | c8 | c16 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| prose | 87.7 | 120.4 (61.9) | 163.6 (41.4) | 237.6 (30.8) | 342.7 (22.2) |
| code | 124.8 | 175.0 (88.4) | 246.8 (63.2) | 309.8 (41.4) | 438.3 (29.3) |
| structured | 152.4 | 177.6 (103.3) | 240.4 (70.4) | 295.5 (44.2) | 572.2 (44.4) |
| json | 118.9 | 174.2 (89.8) | 301.7 (76.2) | 471.5 (60.2) | 659.9 (42.7) |

Prose and code c1 are from the v2.1 fresh-clone boot (prose median of five runs 86.7-87.7 after two
discarded warm-ups); the other columns are from the v2 sweep, whose decode path is identical. With the
deterministic MoE reduction the greedy text is identical run to run, so the sparkDash numbers repeat
within about ±1 tok/s. sparkDash's prose c1 is one prompt, and a stack that sums in a different order
(another fabric, another all-reduce) follows a different greedy text there, so compare step time or a
many-prompt benchmark across stacks. On 45 varied prompts (prose, structured and other catalogs, c1
greedy) the same image runs 58.4 / 94.3 / 71.8 tok/s; decode step 32.4-33.6 ms on prose and
38.9-39.4 ms on code at c1. sparkDash uses a different set of prompts at each concurrency for the
non-prose types, so per-stream values are not comparable across columns. Sampled chat at the model
card's T=1 / top_p=0.95 with thinking (c1, 18 requests x 800 tokens on two prompt sets) ran 67.2 /
65.9 tok/s on the 2026-09-24 stack (sparkDash benches are greedy, where the draft temperature and
block verification do not act).

**Prefill, cold, tok/s by prompt length** (two passes, v2.1)

| 4k | 16k | 32k | 64k | 128k | 262k |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 4119 / 4840 | 5891 / 5846 | 5893 / 5868 | 5936 / 5903 | 5793 / 5761 | 5355 / 5360 |

sparkDash's prefill filler is one repeated token, so every filler token hits the same Engram row and
the row cache inflates these numbers (reported by koldfrontier in
[#21](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/DeepSeek-v4.1-Flash-DGX-Sparks/issues/21)). On real text
(documentation and source code, a unique prefix per prompt so nothing comes from the prefix cache) the
same image measured 4202-4685 / 4824-4922 / 4827-4830 / 4942-4970 / 4822-4871 tok/s at ~4k / ~15k /
~32k / ~62k / ~120k tokens. Needle retrieval (a single phrase in varied filler at 37 % depth): PASS at
99k, 198k, 746k and 1,011,084 tokens (the last in 322-325 s, head `MemAvailable` low-water 7 GiB).

**Quality.** `scripts/qeval.py` runs 75 auto-scored tasks (code executed against hidden asserts, JSON
schema-checked, numeric answers matched, format constraints enforced, prose checked for degeneration;
no LLM judge), one request at a time, temperature 0. The fresh-clone image scores 72 of 75; the three
misses (`code_interval_intersect`, `json_escape`, `math_m9`) fail identically on the stock profile.
Every speed change is meant to be lossless: same weights, every draft token verified by the target,
and each adapter either bit-identical to the stock path (checked at boot or in the in-image tests) or
exact in distribution (draft temperature, block verification). RoCEnante and prefill sequence
parallel sum in a different order than NCCL's all-reduce, so the numerics are not bit-identical to an
NCCL run, which is why the line is also scored. Run qeval from a worker, not from the head (it executes
model-generated Python).

## What runs

| Layer | Setting | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Image | `Dockerfile.canary-roce` | upstream SGLang `dsv4.1` branch at `f80c91a4b` + rhys101's RoCEnante overlay adapted to TP4 + b12x main as `b12x_next` + all adapters; third-party sources fetched at build (`runtime/sources.manifest`) |
| Slots | `MAX_RUNNING_REQUESTS=16` | adds the c16 tier |
| Experts | `EP_SIZE=1`, `DSV41_MOE_B12X_NEXT=1`, `DSV41_MOE_B12X_NEXT_DETERMINISTIC=1` | every rank holds a quarter of all 384 experts and the routed MoE runs on b12x main: no expert-group straggler at the MoE all-reduce (all-reduce 5.9 → ~2.6 ms per step), MoE time unchanged. The deterministic reduction (per-slot buffer and a fixed-order sum instead of atomics) makes greedy output bit-identical run to run |
| Engram | `DSV41_CACHE_GIB=4`, `DSV41_CACHE_WAYS=16`, `DSV41_ENGRAM_PREFETCH=1` | row cache (67–76 % hits) and row lookups on a side stream, rows bit-identical |
| Draft | `DSPARK_BLOCK_SIZE=5`, `SGLANG_DSPARK_FOLDED_SAMPLING=2` | k=5 wins on code, ties on prose at TP4; sampled requests stay in the CUDA graph |
| Draft sampling | `DSV41_DRAFT_TAU=0.7`, `DSV41_BLOCK_VERIFY=1` | sharper draft proposals and block verification for sampled rows, both exact in distribution |
| Verify length | `DSV41_VERIFY_CAP=conf:0.1`, `DSV41_ROUTER_LIVE=1` | verifies only the drafts the confidence head expects to survive; the other verify rows reuse the anchor row's experts inside the router kernel, so they read no extra weights; greedy outputs identical |
| Kernels | `DSV41_SHARED_PAD_K=1`, `DSV41_WO_A_W8=1`, `DSV41_WO_A_W8_MID=1`, `DSV41_WO_A_W8_DROP=1`, `DSV41_DRAFT_HEAD_FP8=1`, `DSV41_DRAFT_HEAD_FP8_IMPL=tp4` | shared expert kept on the b12x kernel; `wo_a` and the draft LM head read exact fp8 twins of their weights |
| Replicated linears | `DSV41_REPLICATED_SPLIT=wqkv_a,engram.wkv`, `DSV41_DRAFT_MAIN_PROJ_SPLIT=1` | layers every rank computed in full are split by columns across ranks and all-gathered; enabled only where bit-identical on all ranks |
| Transport | `SGLANG_ROCE_ALLREDUCE=1`, `SGLANG_ROCE_MAX_SIZE=2097152`, `DSV41_ROCE_GATHER=2097152`, `B12X_ROCE_HCA=rocep1s0f0,roceP2p1s0f0` | TP all-reduces and all-gathers up to 2 MiB over RoCEnante's one-shot RDMA kernel on both rails |
| Prefill | `CHUNKED_PREFILL_SIZE=4096`, `DSV41_INDEXER_CHUNKED=1`, `SPARK_PREFILL_TP_SPLIT=1` | bounded indexer transient (sglang#39187) plus the SG18 row split across ranks from 32k context |
| Loading | `DSV41_FAST_LOAD=1`, `DSV41_FAST_LOAD_TP_SLICE=auto`, `DSV41_AUTOTUNE_KEEP=1` | engine start 343 s → ~120 s; at EP1 each rank reads only its slice of every expert, into 256 MiB pinned slabs; MoE autotune cache kept across boots ([fast-load.md](fast-load.md)) |
| Prefill hc | `DSV41_HC_FUSED=1` | the hyper-connection mix statistics of prefill chunks in one pass over K instead of 80 partial slices: ~1.46 → ~0.83 ms per call at 4096 rows, bit-identical (checked on the first live call) |
| Prefill sequence parallel | `DSV41_PREFILL_SP=1`, `DSV41_PREFILL_SP_FP8=1` | at prefill chunks of >= 2048 rows the per-layer all-reduces become reduce-scatter + all-gather and the per-row work between them runs on each rank's quarter of the rows: prefill ~+20 % from 16k to 262k, decode untouched. `DSV41_PREFILL_SP_EXACT=1` keeps the all-reduce (bit-identical to the unsharded path) for ~+10 %; `_FP8` gathers the attention input as the MXFP8 bytes `wqkv_a` would compute itself (bit-identical per chunk size), +1.5-3 % |
| L2 prefetch | `DSV41_L2_PREFETCH=1` | during each RoCE collective of a decode step a side-stream kernel prefetches the first 6 MB of the weights that follow into L2; data untouched; decode step -1 ms at c1 |
| Correctness | `DSV41_FOLDED_FENCE=1` | closes the sglang#40919 D2H race on the folded verify path |
| Serving | `--enable-cache-report`, `--sleep-on-idle`, `SGLANG_RUST_BUILD_MODE=never` | cached-token usage for clients, idle CPU 47 % → 14 %, avoids a `cargo` hang at start on the branch images |
| Optional | `DSV41_ENGRAM_DRM_NODE=/dev/dri/card0` | one Engram layer's cache in the GB10 display reservation, ~1.8 GiB more headroom; needs a host change ([display-reserve.md](display-reserve.md)) |

Each adapter is described in [tp4-adapters.md](tp4-adapters.md); the image layers on their own and the
line on a switchless ring are in [tp4-optional-setups.md](tp4-optional-setups.md).

## What the profile changes

Against the earlier TP4 example, all of it in `.env.tp4.example` plus gated adapters:

| Setting | Before | Now | Why (measured) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `EP_SIZE` | 4 | **1** (production), 2 (base and canary images) | On the production image every rank streams a 576-wide slice of every touched expert, so no expert group waits for another at the MoE all-reduce. The base and canary images stay at `EP_SIZE=2` (FlashInfer's MXFP4 MoE needs the per-rank width to be a multiple of 128), which already halves the EP4 straggler wait: NCCL time per step 16.5 → 10.2 ms |
| `DSV41_CACHE_GIB` / `WAYS` | 0 / 4 | **4 / 16** | Engram rows repeat (bigram/trigram heads): 67–76 % hit rate, 4x fewer NVMe reads |
| `DSPARK_BLOCK_SIZE` | 3 | **5** | on TP4 k=5 wins on code by ~10 % and ties on prose |
| `MAX_RUNNING_REQUESTS` | 8 | **16** | CUDA graphs to bs 16 cost ~5.6 GB and add a c16 tier (+64 % aggregate over c8) |
| `CHUNKED_PREFILL_SIZE` | 1024 | **4096** | safe only together with the indexer backport below |
| `DSV41_SHARED_PAD_K` | – | **1** | pads the shared expert's K 576 → 640 so it stays on the b12x MXFP8 kernel: −0.9 ms/step, bit-identical |
| `DSV41_INDEXER_CHUNKED` | – | **1** | sglang#39187: indexer logits scored in ≤ 2 GiB row chunks, tail-only candidate masks; a 262k cold prefill keeps ≥ 7 GiB free on the head |
| `SPARK_PREFILL_TP_SPLIT` (canary images) | – | **1** | SG18: the dense prefill indexer's query rows are partitioned across the four ranks from 32k context |
| `DSV41_SERIAL_WEIGHT_LOAD` | 1 | commented, in the ring block | the switched line was measured with the default loader and the fast loader's own pacing |
| `--enable-deepseek-v4-fp4-indexer` | off | on | no effect on V4.1 (no ratio-4 layers; its only indexer is fp4 by design); kept so the argument line matches the measured runs |

Unchanged: memory fraction 0.80, the 8M-token KV pin, 1M context, the NFS/Engram layout, the OpenAI
serving fixes, `--min-free-slots-delay 1`.

## How to run

```bash
cp .env.tp4.example .env.tp4          # HEAD_IP / WORKER_* / MODEL_DIR / fabric, as for any TP4 profile
# production: in .env.tp4 uncomment IMAGE=dsv41-4x-spark:canary-roce, BUILD_DOCKERFILE=Dockerfile.canary-roce
# and the last EXTRA_CONTAINER_ENV line, and set EP_SIZE=1 (the file's EP_SIZE=2 is for the base/canary images)
./start-tp4.sh doctor
./start-tp4.sh build                  # every node: fetches the pinned sources, bakes the adapters, runs the in-image tests
./start-tp4.sh share && ./start-tp4.sh pack   # first time only (NFS share, Engram shards)
./start-tp4.sh serve                  # ./start-tp4.sh stop | status | logs | smoke
```

`build` needs github.com during the image's `fetch` stage (and pypi.org, or `BUILD_ARGS="--build-arg
PIP_INDEX=<mirror>/simple"`). The fetched trees can be inspected on a host with
`scripts/fetch_runtime.sh runtime/fetched`.

The boot log must show these lines, otherwise the line is not active:

```
DSV41 shared-expert padding K: ... (5120, 576) -> (5120, 640)
DSV41 indexer chunked (sglang#39187 backport) ARMED: ...
Initialized DSpark draft runner. ... gamma=5, verify_num_draft_tokens=6
max_total_num_tokens=..., chunked_prefill_size=4096, ... max_running_requests=16
RoCEnante ready: world=4 hcas=...
[moe_b12x_next] armed: routed MoE on b12x_next e4084d2e ...
[moe_b12x_next] INFO: routed MoE at EP_SIZE=1 ...
DSV41 hc_fused: first call (4096 rows) bit-identical to stock
```

## Measuring

- Bench with sparkDash's decode and prefill benches; discard the first two runs after a boot (cold
  Engram row cache, first-run warm-up).
- Any `#running-req` in the engine log above the concurrency being benched means foreign traffic
  landed in the window.
- A dashboard polling `nvidia-smi` every 2 s on every node costs ~0.6 ms per decode step; poll every
  10 s.
- sparkDash's fixed prompts are greedy: a change that alters rounding can flip a near-tie early in the
  256 tokens and move c1 by ±10 % without changing speed. Kernel A/Bs use step time on several prompts
  as well.
- Greedy text equality is not a correctness gate for prefill changes: identical cold prompts of ~70k
  tokens produce different greedy continuations run to run. Correctness of the backports rests on the
  bitwise CPU tests, the needle tests and qeval.

## Rollback

Every layer is an env change: `EP_SIZE=2` without `DSV41_MOE_B12X_NEXT` returns the routed MoE to
FlashInfer, `DSV41_FAST_LOAD=0` restores the stock loader, `SGLANG_ROCE_ALLREDUCE=0` drops the RDMA
transport, `SPARK_PREFILL_TP_SPLIT=0` the row split, `IMAGE=dsv41-4x-spark:canary` the RoCEnante
overlay, `IMAGE=dsv41-4x-spark:local` the branch. The earlier TP4 example: `MAX_RUNNING_REQUESTS=8`,
`CHUNKED_PREFILL_SIZE=1024`, `DSPARK_BLOCK_SIZE=3`, `EXTRA_CONTAINER_ENV=""`, `EP_SIZE=4`,
`DSV41_CACHE_GIB=0`. The adapters stay in the image but do nothing when their gate is unset.

## Known limits

- The numbers above are on a switched RoCE fabric. On a switchless ring RoCEnante needs a path to the
  opposite node, built in the neighbours' ConnectX-7 hardware
  ([switchless-ring.md](switchless-ring.md#rocenante-on-the-ring-hardware-forwarded-opposite-node-paths));
  without it the collectives go through NCCL and decode is slower. Prefill is lower on a ring either
  way (one-link bisection).
- The EP1 line needs the `Dockerfile.canary-roce` image (it carries `b12x_next`). The routed MoE on
  b12x is numerically equivalent to FlashInfer's, not bit-identical (relative error against an fp32
  reference 4.5–4.8 % for both); qeval and the needle tests are unchanged.
- Single-stream prose speed is bounded by DSpark acceptance (~3 accepted tokens per step on prose
  against ~6 on code).
- The fast loader leaves the KV pool smaller than the stock loader and more variable between boots;
  `DSV41_FAST_LOAD=0` restores it at ~220 s per boot ([fast-load.md](fast-load.md)).
- RoCEnante is a new transport in the decode path; b12x has one open report of a rank wedging under
  long mixed-context traffic on an earlier revision
  ([b12x#313](https://github.com/local-inference-lab/b12x/issues/313)). The overlay's result-boundary
  health check fails the step instead of hanging, and NCCL is one env change away.
